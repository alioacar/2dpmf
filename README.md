This is a tool for calculating two dimensional potential of mean force profile (the free energy maps) of ion channels.  It is calculating the unbiased probability distrubutions of cations using the trajectories obtained from long-scaled molecular dynamics simulations. Since it using the catdcd plugin of VMD, both Gromacs and NAMD trajectory files can be processed. Set your own parameters in the input.ini file. Execute the configure script first. That will create pdb files in the "tempfiles" directory. Then compile it with the "make" command. It is using GNU fortran compiler. That will create a symbolinc executable link in the main directory. Just execute it with typing "./2dpmf". The free energy profiles will be written in the "/Results" directory.
