# This is a tool for calculating two dimensional potential of mean force profile (the free energy maps) of ion channels.  It is calculating the unbiased probability distrubutions of cations using the trajectories obtained from long-scaled molecular dynamics simulations. Since it using the catdcd plugin of VMD, both Gromacs and NAMD trajectory files can be processed.
